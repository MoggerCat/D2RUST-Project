# Task: q-fix-monster-death (from the coordinator, 2026-10-09)

You are session q-fix-monster-death of the D2RUST-Project cloud build loop (Rust reimplementation of Diablo II LoD 1.14d, held to exact match; goal: the whole game playable start to finish). BRANCH = q-fix-monster-death. REC ids: REC-1090..REC-1099 only.

Area: monster death and its clean-up (d2-sim units/combat death path).
Tasks: queue rows q-fix-p4-death-cleanup (killed monsters stand back up: mode 1 with hp 0, bosses included) and q-fix-real-monster-drop-spot (drops land beside the death point, +2/+3 sub-tiles, per the recording). Rows in docs/handoff/build-queue.tsv carry the spec pointers. Prove with tools/scenario-diff checks of a kill (state channel), e.g. the combat-* checks in traces/checks/, and a playthrough kill milestone. q-fix-boss-damage owns why bosses take no damage; you own what happens once hp reaches 0.

Other sessions running now (don't take their work; tools/coord/owners.tsv): q-fix-input-lock (client cast input lock), q-fix-client-crash (geom crash, walk desync), q-fix-boss-damage (Andariel/Radament), q-fix-items-shop (shop room, belt after load, monster items), q-fix-npc-menus, q-fix-a1-den-wp, q-fix-class-rows (whirlwind, aura, pet follow, hammer), q-fix-pt-sweep (playthrough tool, Act III-V matrix), plus the batch-2 sessions q-fix-monster-death, q-fix-player-hit, q-fix-monster-ai, q-fix-seed-order, q-fix-save-input, q-fix-room-links, q-fix-act2-play, q-fix-act4-play, q-fix-act5-play, q-fix-check-triage, q-fix-realdata-baseline, q-fix-difficulty-a1a2.

RULES:
Coordinator: session_01KcnkwCTXbuv5ZbToEUpBSj (message it with send_message).

Setup: `git fetch origin claude/specs-staging-7 claude/q-fix-monster-death && git checkout -B claude/q-fix-monster-death origin/claude/q-fix-monster-death && sh tools/coord/sync.sh` (merges the latest staging). Read CLAUDE.md, then only the sections of docs you need (docs/METHODS.md M01, M22, M23, M25 at least). Game files: attach MoggerCat/D2RUST-private-repo (add_repo), sparse-clone it per its README.md (`extracted tools install`), `python3 tools/assemble.py /home/user/game`, then `D2_GAME_DIR=/home/user/game`; build the excel view with `tools/realdata-gate.sh` if a test needs it. Never copy private files into the public repo. Bevy system libs: `apt-get install -y pkg-config libwayland-dev libasound2-dev libudev-dev libxkbcommon-dev`.

Session rules:
- Just push to claude/q-fix-monster-death (git push -u origin claude/q-fix-monster-death); the coordinator merges. No PRs.
- Message the coordinator only when a blocker is fixed (with the playthrough count: `python3 tools/playthrough/playthrough.py <file> --build` reached/total), when blocked, or when done.
- Stay in your area (tools/coord/owners.tsv; `python3 tools/coord/route.py <path>` names the owner of a file outside your area: send a note to that session or the coordinator instead of editing).
- Run `sh tools/coord/sync.sh` every 30 minutes.
- Read only what you need (specs by section index, M11).
- Exact match with 1.14d stays the bar (CLAUDE.md rule 10): fix the first divergence a check shows; never weaken a test or expect a bug. Unsettled choices are PROVISIONAL with your REC ids (M22).
- Before each push: `cargo fmt --all`, `cargo clippy -p <crates you touched> --all-targets -- -D warnings`, `cargo nextest run -p <those crates>`, `python3 tools/coverage.py --check`, `python3 tools/spec_index.py --check`. Disk is limited: `rm -rf target/debug/incremental` after big builds.
- PC 1 questions (need the Windows game or Ghidra): add unnumbered items "- [q-fix-monster-death] title" to docs/handoff/pc1-data.md Step 4; the coordinator numbers them.
- At the end write docs/handoff/q-fix-monster-death.md (done / open / repro commands), push, send "done" once to the coordinator, then stop.
