//! Bevy client. Renders state and sends intents; never decides outcomes.
//! All contact with the game goes through [`bridge`].
//!
//! [`map`] is plain Rust (no Bevy types): asset assembly and the CPU
//! reference renderer used to check the GPU output. [`scene`] is plain
//! Rust too: the draw list and the CPU reference compositor, as is
//! [`composite`], which turns COF frames into scene draw items.
//! [`gpu_compositor`] is the GPU twin of the CPU compositor; [`verify`]
//! runs the render cases (CPU reference vs GPU). [`world_view`] turns the
//! bridge's client world into the frame's draw list and composes it.
//! [`facts`] writes and compares rendering fact sets (`facts/render/`).
