// Spec: specs/world/npc.md (§3 chat close), specs/client/msg-ui.md (§16); preview fill: docs/handoff/q-quests.md
//! The play preview's chat close. The original closes the NPC chat
//! (C→S 0x30) when the dialog ends: the speech played out, the menu or
//! box closed. The preview has neither the speech (sound is deferred)
//! nor the NPC menu (`stitch-npc2`, left item 1), so the dialog branch
//! (`client/msg-ui.md` §16 r4.3) is followed at once by the close, in the
//! same frame, after the 0x2F and the quest message 0x31. The server
//! then runs the chat end (`QuestControl::npc_deactivate`) and a second
//! talk starts a fresh interaction.
//!
//! d2rs-own, unverified; REC-104 in `docs/HANDOFF.md` §7 (the original's
//! close is 15 frames after the message in the recorded session).
