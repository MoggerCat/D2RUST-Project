// Spec: specs/tools/rng-trace.md §3 (the d2rs export)
//! The RNG draw log's way out of the server (`rng-trace` feature): a link
//! whose server thread can drain its draw log (`d2_sim::debug::rng_trace`)
//! and read the known seeds implements [`RngTraceSource`]; the bridge
//! forwards the request, so the debug export reaches the game through the
//! bridge like everything else (CLAUDE.md rule 5).
