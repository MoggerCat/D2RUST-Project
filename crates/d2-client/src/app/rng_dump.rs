// Spec: specs/tools/rng-trace.md §3 (the d2rs export)
//! `d2-client state-dump ... --rng FILE`: every seeded draw of the dump's
//! server game (`d2_sim::debug::rng_trace`, `rng-trace` feature) as
//! `rng-raw-1` lines with frame and owner, the format `record_rng.py
//! --frames` writes on 1.14d (`rng-trace.md` §1).
//!
//! The log is per thread and off by default: [`start_with`] builds the
//! game as [`single_player::start_with`] does, but turns the log on in
//! the server thread before the game is created, so game creation's
//! draws are there (frame 0). After every bridge frame [`RngDump::drain`]
//! takes the server's draws and the known seeds through the bridge
//! ([`crate::bridge::rng_trace`]), assigns frames and owners on this
//! thread and writes the lines. The log only copies values: the dump's
//! game and its state lines are the same with or without `--rng`
//! (`rng-trace.md` §3 r2). Built without the feature, `--rng` is an
//! error.
