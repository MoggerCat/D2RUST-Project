//! `play`'s game start: the command line (`--save`, `--new`, `--difficulty`,
//! `--hardcore`, `--save-dir`) or the front end's choice
//! ([`StartChoice`]) resolved into the character the join loads, the file
//! it is saved to and the 0x67 flags. `main` runs [`resolve`] before the
//! game window opens, so a bad folder or a taken name stops there. No game
//! logic (CLAUDE.md rule 5).
