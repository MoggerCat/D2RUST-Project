// Spec: specs/sim/pathing.md
//! Walk and run: the mode request (C→S 0x01–0x04), the position resync
//! (C→S 0x5F, §1.6), path types 1, 2 and 7, missile paths (§11),
//! path compute, target preparation, toward / straight / A*, velocity,
//! direction and facing, per-tick movement, and the S→C byte builders of
//! §10.
//!
//! Seams: [`seams::PathWorld`] (path record store, footprints by unit,
//! room lists, on the core's [`crate::path::CollisionRooms`]) and
//! [`seams::WalkUnits`] (units, modes, timers, stats, skills, messages),
//! both on one context object (the provider holds the game, units, DRLG
//! grids and path store together). Records, tables, collision queries
//! and footprint moves are the path core's (`sim/path-placement.md`
//! §1–§6).
//! Integer and 16.16 fixed-point arithmetic only (CLAUDE.md rule 6): the
//! x87 target lead adds 0 in 1.14d (pathing.md §3), and the blessed
//! hammer's float32 products are computed exactly from the sine table's
//! bit patterns ([`sine`]).
