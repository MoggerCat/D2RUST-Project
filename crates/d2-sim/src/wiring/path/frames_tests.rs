//! Creation flag 0x400 on the wired units and the path provider: the
//! current frame comes from the distance between the missile's path
//! position and its path target point (`0x006417F0`), so a lobbed missile
//! (Fire Blast, `skills/use.md` §5.5) lands at its target instead of
//! expiring on its first run.
