//! Quests → the NPC control block: the mercenary reward `0x00579180`
//! (`npc.md` §7.5, [`NpcControl::quest_mercenary`]) that an Act I quest
//! grants from C→S 0x31 (`quests-act1.md` §10.2, Kashya's message 92).
//!
//! The quest code reaches the reward through its world
//! ([`crate::world::quests::QuestWorld::mercenary_reward`]) while it holds
//! the quest control block and the economy; the reward needs the NPC
//! control block and the desk as its world, which the quest call is
//! using. So [`Desk::quest_message`] queues the reward during the quest
//! call, with every send the call makes after it
//! ([`crate::wiring::economy::QuestDeferred`]), and runs the queue right
//! after the call, before the message's result is returned: the reward's
//! 0x50 and the hireling's creation messages, then the text refresh's
//! 0x27 / 0x29, the 1.14d order (`quests-act1-rest.md` §8 item 8).
//!
//! Order of the other effects: of the records the list dispatch visits
//! after chain 2's message-92 handler (`act1::scroll`), chains 3–6 have no
//! message-92 case, but chain 37 (Act I intro) has an event-11 function
//! `0x0058F870` without a written body (it reaches
//! [`crate::wiring::economy::QuestRest::unhandled`]). In 1.14d that
//! function runs after the reward; here before it.
//!
//! TODO(quests.tsv chain 37, `npc.md` §7.5): the deferral is the same
//! order as 1.14d only if `0x0058F870` does nothing observable for
//! message 92 (open question in `docs/handoff/wire-open-seams.md`).
//!
//! A reward reached through another entry (no queue) still goes to
//! [`crate::wiring::economy::QuestRest::mercenary_reward`].
