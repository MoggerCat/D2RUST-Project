// Spec: specs/world/cube.md (§1), specs/items/generation.md (§10.3)
//! The Horadric Cube as a made-up item (`box `, a 2 × 4 `misc` row of its
//! own item type) for tests that need a character to carry one. Added on
//! top of [`crate::synth::synthetic`] by a caller that wants it, so the
//! shared set (and the counts other tests assert on) stays unchanged.
